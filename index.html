                    <li> This vis utilizes color as a good mapping technique as it is clearly distinguishable which states were red (Republican) and which states were blue (Democratic) in the map.</li>
                    <li> This vis also utilizes length as a good mapping technique, because it can clealy be seen when the length of the line reaches the arrow. </li>

                <ul>
                    <li> Colors (red and blue) to represent which candidate was voted for, Length on the top bar to show when enough electoral votes were reached </li>

                <ul>
                    <li> Colormaps: Categorical, as the political party is either Democrat or Republican (categories)</li>
                    <li> The colormaps are done well because there are two distinctly different colors for the two parties.</li>

            <ul>
                <li> Channels: Position (both) with horizontal representing exit velocity and vertical representing launch angle, color to represent if the scoring value was above or below average</li>
                <li>The use of horizontal/vertical position is good mapping as it allows the velocity of the ball to be compared to its launch angle.</li>
                <li>The use of color is also a good mapping technique as the points on the map with an above-average LWTS are highlighted by the darker yellow color.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2 class="bold">Colormap</h2>
            <ul>
                <li> Colormaps: Divergent, as the LWTS score is colored based on two extreme colors (purple and yellow) that diverge in the middle.</li>
                <li>The colormap is done well as displaying if a score is above or below average can easily be seen based on the divergent colors.</li>

        <h2 class="bold">Channels</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Channels: Position displayed on a geosptail map of America based on latitude and longitude, color to represent the temperature at that location on a certain day</li>
            <li>The use of horizontal/vertical position is good as it takes a familiar sight, a map of America and overlays some temeprature data on it.</li>
            <li>The use of color is also a good mapping technique as it is divergent and that is a good way to display temperature data that ranges from hot to cold.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="bold">Colormap</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Colormaps: Divergent, as the color bar has a gradient going from green to purple. </li>
            <li>The colormap is done well as it displays the ranges of temperature easily to the viewer</li>
